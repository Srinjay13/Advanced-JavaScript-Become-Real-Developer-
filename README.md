This notes for JS includes "Scopes, Execution context and Closures" ; "this keyword" ; "Object-Oriented Programming" ; "Fetch API and HTTP Basics". This is a tutorial by Sheriyans Coding School, so all the credit goes to them, I just made a note out of the lecture for my future self to brush on JS concepts if I need to !
